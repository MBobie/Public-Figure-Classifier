# Public-Figure-Classifier
In this project focused on data science and machine learning, we embark on the classification of sports personalities, narrowing our scope to 11 specific individuals:
1. Kennedy Agyapong
2. Elon Musk
3. Noni Madueke
4. Seth Rollins
5. Lionel Messi
6. Cristiano Ronaldo

10. Dwayne Johnson
11. Lyrical Joe

We have organized the project into the following directory structure:
- UI: Contains the code for the user interface website.
- Server: A Python Flask server.
- Model: Includes a Python notebook for building the model.
- google_image_scraping: Script to scrape Google for images.
- images_dataset: The dataset utilized for training our model.

The technologies leveraged in this project include:
1. Python, for general programming.
2. Numpy and OpenCV, for data cleaning processes.
3. Matplotlib & Seaborn, for visualizing data.
4. Sklearn, for building the machine learning model.
5. Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm as Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).
6. Python Flask, for the HTTP server.
7. HTML/CSS/JavaScript, for the development of the user interface.
